# advantage-of-disadvantage
This repository is a response to the fivethrityeight.com aricle entitled [Can You Find The Best Dungeons &amp; Dragons Strategy?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-the-best-dungeons-dragons-strategy/)

## The Call
On May 15, 2020. FiveThrityEight.com published an aricle entitled, 'Can You Find The Best Dungeons & Dragons Strategy?'. In it they postulate that rolling one die when you have advantage and disadvantage is yawn inducing, 'Yawn!'

They propose (while certainly worse for gameplay) two 'more mathematically interesting ways' to combine advantage and disadvantage.

### “advantage of disadvantage”
roll twice with disadvantage and then keep the higher result

### "disadvantage of advantage”
roll twice with advantage and then keep the lower result

## The Question they pose
Which situation produces the highest expected roll: advantage of disadvantage, disadvantage of advantage or rolling a single die?

## Answer
Take disadvantage of advantage

result from a run with 10,000,000 rolls
> `regular expected roll                   10.499731925`

> `advantage of disadvantage expected roll 9.8337565`

> `disadvantage of advantage expected roll 11.1661691`

### Moral of the story
Adding this to your game causes more computation and arguing. If that is your thing, great! However I wouldn't reccomend this to your game. Instead I would get some old Dnd v 3.5 books from the discount bin and play that instead. Way way way more computation and arguing than you could ever hope for in 5e.
